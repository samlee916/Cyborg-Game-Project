- Execution:
-- Cyborg energy level needs to increase in proportion with energyStation during cyborg/energyStation collision.
-- Energy station capacity needs to decrease to 0 during cyborg/energyStation collision.
-- Energy station color needs to fade during cyborg/energyStation collision.
-- A new energy station needs to be created during cyborg/energyStation collision.
-- Cyborg heading needs to increment or decrement on clock tick in relation to the steeringDirection.
-- Drone objects need to update their position on clock tick.
-- Cyborg damage level needs to increase after Cyborg/Drone collision.
-- Number of lives going into negative (below 0) without game exiting.
-- Game needs to end when cyborg reaches last base in sequential order, print "Game Over, you win! Total time: " to console, and exit.
-- Energy level is going into negative (below 0) without loosing a life.
-- Speed limit needs to be limited by cyborg's damage.
-- Steering must stay within 40 degrees of left or right of straight ahead.

- In UML:
-- Starter failed to have a has-a relationship with Game.
-- GameWorld [One] failed to have a has-a one to many relationship with GameObjects[ Many (*)].
-- GameObject, Fixed, and Movable need to be abstract.
-- ISteerable should be an interface.
-- Base should have setColor() method.

- In Code:
-- setSize() method cannot be public in GameObject.
-- Base should have setColor() method.
